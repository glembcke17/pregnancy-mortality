			Pregnancy-associated mortality has been a major issue in the state of New York, with deaths occurring in 18.5 percent of 100,000 live births between 2018 and 2020, according to <a href= "https://health.ny.gov/press/releases/2024/2024-03-14_maternal_mortality.htm" target=_blank title="New York State Health Department Releases Maternal Mortality Reports Detailing Stark Racial, Ethnic Disparities
			">New York State Department of Heath</a>. Seeing this problem, in 2022, Mayor Eric Adams alongside New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan delivered HealthyNYC, which <a href= "https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/642-22/mayor-adams-signs-legislation-providing-doula-services-across-five-boroughs-strengthen-maternal#/0" target=_blank title="Mayor Adams Signs Legislation Providing Doula Services Across Five Boroughs, Strengthen Maternal Health">expanded access</a> to various maternal services, such as doulas, sexual and reproductive education, provided access to data on maternal mortality, among many others. </p>

			<p>“[...]We set a goal through HealthyNYC to reduce Black maternal mortality by 10 percent by 2030, as Black women are four times more likely to experience a pregnancy-associated death compared to white women in New York City. We will continue to work to close these equity gaps and give every family the healthy, supportive foundation they need to thrive,” <a href= "https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/371-24/mayor-adams-over-12-000-families-served-maternal-infant-health-services-since" target=_blank title= "Mayor Adams Announces Over 12,000 Families Served With Maternal and Infant Health Services Since Expanding Access to Doulas and Home Visitors">said Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Anne Williams-Isom</a>.

			However, <a href= "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Pregnancy-Associated-Mortality/27x4-cbi6/about_data" target=_blank title= "Pregnancy-Associated Mortality">NYCOpenData</a> has not updated the statistics on pregnancy-associated mortality, with the last data being from 2021. The New York City News Service attempted to contact the DOHMH, which is in charge of this information but received no response.

</script>

			<p>NYCity News Service analyzed the data and found that between 2016-2021, 128 Black women died from pregnancy-related reasons. On the contrary, 27 Asian/Pacific Islanders, 86 Latinas, 52 White, and 6 women who identified as other passed in that same period.The numbers show that pregnancy-related deaths among Black women are much higher.

			As the data suggests, Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) have been undermined by the medical industry, leading to various deaths and medical complications, according to <a href= "https://www.kff.org/key-data-on-health-and-health-care-by-race-and-ethnicity/?entry=health-status-and-outcomes-birth-risks-and-outcomes" target=_blank title="KFF"> KFF</a>. The source analyzed pregnancy-associated deaths accross the United States, which showed a significant difference in BIPOC individuals as opposed to their white counterparts.

			In a <a href= "https://www.kff.org/key-data-on-health-and-health-care-by-race-and-ethnicity/?entry=health-status-and-outcomes-birth-risks-and-outcomes" target= _blank title= "Figure 16: Maternal Mortality per 100,000 Births by Race and Ethnicity, 2018-2022">dataset</a> gathered by KFF, maternal mortality in the United States per 100,000 birth by race and ethnicity between 2018-2022 were analyzed and they found that nearly or more than half of all the deaths that occured in that time span were Black women. This further spolidifies that racial inequality in the medical industry continues to persist.
